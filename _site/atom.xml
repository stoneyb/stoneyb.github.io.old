  <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>I wanted to bring in 2016 with a new online prescence and place to put some of my work and thoughts. This has been on my TODO list for quite some time and I finally sat down the other day to spend some real time looking at my options. After some poking I found <a title="Github Pages" href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> which is free (!) and very easy to setup, even with a custom domain. It seemed <a title="Jekyll" href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> was the next obvious choice. It is a joy to work with, adding and modifying content or styling is a breeze. There are also many open source Jekyll themes developed by talented people all over the world, I am using <a href="https://github.com/biomadeira/sustain">sustain</a> and <a href="https://github.com/biomadeira/vitae">vitae</a>. I highly recommend this setup if you’re looking for a quick and easy way to setup a simple website.</p>

<p>Over the coming months and years I hope to extend this blog with more technical topics, focusing on iOS development to start. The goal is two fold. The first is selfish, I would like to document some of the problems and solutions I encounter day to day providing me a place to come back to in the probable case I run into that same situation again. Secondly, as a resource to other developers who may also run into similar problems. So please stay tuned, and feel free to get in touch if there is something I can help you with or vice versa.</p>
